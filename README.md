### Jr Developer with 8 months experience working with python.  I also have 18 months experience developing Filemaker applications. At MGH I have developed python programs designed to filter and process previously unused data. That data is then visualized using Tableau. Currently in my free time I am learning the Django Framework in order to develop websites and APIâ€™s. I am seeking an opportunity to fully devote myself to learning backend software development. ðŸ‘‹
